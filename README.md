# billfeed

> A Vue.js project

The purpose of developing this web application was to create a centralized platform for organizations that are pushing for social or political change, such as non-profits, to display bills currently going through Congress. Since these bills may be quite dense and convoluted to read, we wanted organizations to be able to comment on and annotate the bills that they choose to display, such as by highlighting its good parts in green and its bad parts in red. Although we did not have enough time to finish the annotation function, users are currently able to view bill titles, click into bills for more information, and find their senators and representatives by inputting their zipcodes. A future addition to this platform will be a side panel that pulls congressmen's emails in order to auto-generate an email stub about a chosen bill. The user can then either personalize the email with specific opinions about the issue or send the general support/opposition email as-is.
